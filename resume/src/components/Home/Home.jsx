               <p className='content'>I am a sociable person, experienced in working as part of a team, as well as helping others integrate, due to my previous jobs. I pay close attention to details and I am keen to learning as much as I can.
    I am also a self-starter, I introduced myself in a technical field by studying by myself at first. My motivation always overcomes my fears of not succeding or failing at first. I consider my ambition my most valuable asset </p>
