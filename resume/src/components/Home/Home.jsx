					I am a sociable person, experienced in working as part of a team, as
					well as helping others integrate, due to my previous jobs. I pay close
					attention to details and I am keen to learning as much as I can. I am
					also a self-starter, I introduced myself in a technical field by
					studying by myself at first. My motivation always overcomes my fears
					of not succeding or failing at first. I consider my ambition my most
					valuable asset{" "}
